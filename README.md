Grabs the Principal ID of any Mario Kart 7 player you come across.

Mainly used to report hackers on Pretendo Network.

How To Install

JPN: 0004000000030600
EUR: 0004000000030700

Create a folder with the id in sd:/luma/plugins and put the plugin in there.
Upon booting mk7, your screen should flash a color. Press select to open the menu.

When joining an online match, the plugin should automatically log the pricipal id of the players you come across, as well as being able to detect spoofed pid's
